# <CS361 GROUP24 LEARNING STUDY MICROSERVICE>
As a microservice, my partner could make something that takes in many strings as input, and creates a .csv file from it.

My program sends to my partner microservice a request ("give me a list of videos about algebra") and my microservice gives a simple reply back to me program


## Description

GOAL:
Refactor our old webpage interface to achieve better conversion and interaction on the login page with users.

Basically, when the user request the service from the webpage, my microservice manages its own data to the microservices principle. A single data store shouldn't be shared by two services. Instead, each service is in charge of maintaining its own private data stores, which other services are unable to directly access. Therefore, when the user request the ask question, first the server will find the answer and explanation for the database, than if the database did‚Äôt have the answer, the server will sent the request to the expert for the response.
